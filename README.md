# Problem Identification

## Case Study:

It is January 2022 we are tasked to asist Airbnb to find suitible host in New York and to market them to potential visitors looking for a place to stay. due to COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020 there has been a huge decresee in revenue from 30% to 10% and numbers of booking as well as host leaving the platform. 

After COVID-19 subsided in the year 2022 airbnb wants to increase thier revenue by at least 20% due to the decrease in numbers of booking from the last few years, by marketing potential host and marketing potential visitors to use airbnb as their platform to find a temporary stay in new york in the hopes to increase revenue and an increase of number of booking, while also competing against other simmilar companies wanting to gain new host in new york.

Note:
- revenue is currenltly low of 10 %.

# Data Analysis and Insights

Based on the analysis above we can gather that.

- The area with the most potential for marketing to potential host is the Manhattan and Brooklyn due to the fact it has the highest price.

- Based on the month distribution we can see that June is the most popular month people book rooms in air bnb, we can market visitors for that specific month.

- Since entire house/apartments are the more popular we can market potential visitors to the area of manhattan/Brooklyn with entire house/apartments host.

- based on the distribution of neighborhood groups manhattan has the highest number of listing, Manhattan is the most popular, although we can also opt for Brooklyn to take initiative for to find potential host there because it seems to be growing in popularity, which we can plan a marketing strategy based on that.

- we can see based on the distribution of price most host tend to price their rooms around 60 - 69 USD so we can set out price range in order to attract more potential visitors.

- based on the anova test we can gather that there is a big difference between the price and the locations, although Brooklyn has the most number of host, manhattan has the highest price. the ANOVA test can also be seen by the tree map, where the smallest weight being Stanen Island being the cheapest place. but it also has the most reviews although we cannot determind if it is positive or negative, we can assume it is not a good potential marketing area to find potential host. <b>on the other hand we can also focus on building a a potential good area in staten island in the future, becuase currently we are not in the situation to do so we will save that option for later</b>

- Key point in the data:

  - Manhattan is the best place to market with the highest price.
  - Brooklyn is the most dense area with many potential host and a growing popularity, we can also market our service to Brooklyn.
  - June being the most popular time to stay in New York we could mareket to the visitors a month before.
  - We can also focus on building a a potential good area in staten island for future projects.
